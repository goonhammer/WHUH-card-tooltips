Plugin for WHUW Card Tooltips
============================

Enables card images to show on mouseover for Warhammer Underworlds cards. It
provides a button (and corresponding shortcode tags) that wrap card names or
deck listings and turn them into smart card links with image tooltips.



Support and Development
-----------------------

The code in this plugin is inspired from the MTG variant. Just like that guy,
I am not a PHP developer, so I'm  pretty sure the code here is not 
*the right way to do it* and I'll gladly accept pull requests with improvements
and / or code cleanup.
